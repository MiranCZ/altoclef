AltoClef's main purpose was to speedrun the game. This branch is aimed to fulfill that goal again. But I would still like the bot to be reliable, so finishing one of hundreds of runs is not what I want to be aiming for. Both AltoClef and Baritone on here have been backported to 1.16.1.


## Contributions are welcome!
I do not plan to work on this much for the time being, so contributions are more than welcome (and who knows, it might even spark motivation in me to work on this gain!).

## Some things that could be optimized:
*(ordered from most to least feasible imo)*


- Reliably surviving in less than diamond armor
- Most of the time is spent in the nether, some (at least basic) bastion routing would help so much
- Water navigation, swimming, shipwreck looting would also help (but a whole new pathfinding system would need to be created)
- Zero cycle would be pretty dang cool to pull off, but I feel like that one is not even possible
